How would I define the experience I want to share?
Key word: Illumination

### Gameplay
The illumination will be the key to pass the game, in simple words. The light that surrounds the player will guide him on the correct path. For example there is a two paths in front of the player, he will need to observe which one is the more advantageous for him walking in the light or fighting the shadows. Much like in the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

### Aesthetics
The light that shines in the game-world is ever fickle, depending on its behavior your surroundings can change from a peaceful grove to a nightmarish one.

### Narrative
In the game-world there is a constant battle between two principles, light and shadow. Which one will remain in the end, the objective of the player is neither to help one or the other, but to restore balance between them.

### Technology
The main target is a PC, but I am open to the possibility to adapt it to VR. Meaning Occulus, SteamVR, etc.

### Market
The target-meta are teens and young adults that are interested in games that don’t really hold your hand. This game isn’t a 5 minutes gameplay for every 15 minutes of cinematics. You must rely on your sense of observation.
