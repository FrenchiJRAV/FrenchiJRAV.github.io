### Analysis
After receiving feedback from my peers, I would say that I am a person that tends to do my work at the last possible moment while still doing it without huge problems. I may not be the best at creating an awesome model, but I can deliver a result on which can be worked on and improved. The fact that I know when to limit myself is a huge plus, because no matter if I am excited to do a particular project I consider my abilities and the time I have, to produce a result that is finished in the best balance between deadlines and abilities.
### Pros
* 3 spoken and written languages
* Hears the ideas of others and give them feedback
* Good social skills
* Interested in learning, from coding to 3D models
* Knows when to limit himself

### Cons
* Little to none patience
* Does not work on the project the moment it's made
* Way to self-critical, thinks that almost everything he does is not up to par  
* Tends to thinks simply
* Lack of visual design skills (Example: A Blog)
