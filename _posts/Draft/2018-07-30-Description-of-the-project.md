### Introduction
This project has for objective to observe how we as player react to a particular environment.
How we feel when we are in the light and can see every detail of the objects around us.
How we feel when we are alone in the shadows. How all of this has an effect on the human psicology
and how the human mind can be trained to certain tasks.

### Emotional state

### Theme
Every detail of the game depends on the illumination. The illumination has the power to
transform the surroundings of the "player", it has the ability to help or harm him.
The main concepts are light and shadow, how it affects our perception and how
we think when we are in one or the other.

Amnesia The Dark Descent: I think the theme that this game present is the balance
between mental and physical health. When you are in the light you feel safe so you don't suffer
damage to your mental health. But it is easier to be found by the monster and suffer physical
health. That is why you hide in the shadows.

Limbo: Everything in this game depends on how we perceive and analysis the shapes around us, we don't see the color or texture of the objects surrounding us. It all depends on how we process information.

Outlast: It mainly uses space as a way to communicate with the player, I admit that the gore also sends a message. But I believe that the use of space also influences the player at the moment in which he decides his path. Right or left?

### Reach and limits of the project
The project is a small "game" in where there are many areas. Each one with a different
amount of illumination. It's purpose is to make the player feel differently depending
on the zone he is in.

It is NOT a game that has an end game or objective. It can be considered a small
and controlled experiment.
